SousChef

I created this application out of my own need for having access to recipes in a hands-free way. Sometimes in the middle of cooking I would need to know the ingredients or the next step in the instructions, but greasy or floury hands are not ideal for laptops or tablets. I set out to make a recipe application that would read out all the text, and the audio player could be controlled using webcam gestures. SousChef is the product of that inspiration.

SousChef is the first web application I created, and it was an independent project where I wore all the hats in full-stack development. SousChef was built using Ruby on Rails as the framework. It used Devise for User account management, and Heroku for deployment. The search feature is powered by web-scraping Epicurious using code written with Mechanize. User file upload is handedled by setting up Carrierwave with Amazon's S3 cloud storage. Text-to-speech is handled by a gem that uses Google Translation, and the webcam gesture feature was built using HTML5 and javascript. The styling was done with CSS,HTML, and Bootstrap.
